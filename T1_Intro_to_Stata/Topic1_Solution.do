//Sort the data in order of mpg, is this sort order unique
sort mpg
duplicates report mpg // The presence of duplicates (where "copies" is greater than 1) indicates that the sort order of the dataset based on mpg is not unique. This means that multiple cars have the same mpg value, and therefore, sorting by mpg alone does not result in a uniquely ordered dataset. To create a unique sort order, you might need to sort by additional variables (for example, mpg and price).

//  Generate a new variable called domestic which is equal to one if the vehicle is domestic and zero if the vehicle is foreign.

// Sort the data in order of miles per gallon and price. Generate a new variable called obsno10 holding the observation number + 10.
